### Senior AI/ML Engineer | Full Stack Engineer | Mobile Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub!
I’m an **AI/ML** and **Full Stack** engineer who loves turning ideas into real, usable products.
I build things across **web**, **mobile**, and **AI**, from **chatbots** and **agents** to full apps people actually use.
If it can be automated or made smarter, I’m probably interested.
